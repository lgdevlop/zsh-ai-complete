echo "source ~/.zsh-ai-complete/zsh-ai-complete.plugin.zsh" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

```

Reload with:

```zsh
omz reload   # if using Oh My Zsh

## 🛠 Configuration

On first use, the plugin creates:

```bash
~/.config/zsh-ai-complete/ai-providers.json
```

Based on the example:

```bash
example.ai-providers.json
```

Customize it with your tokens and preferences:

```json
{
  "openai": {
    "url": "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions",
    "token": "your_api_key",
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "system_message": "You must output exactly five complete zsh commands. No explanations, no comments, no code blocks, no numbering, no blank lines. Output only the commands, one per line.",
    "output_path": ".choices[0].message.content"
  }
}
```

---

## 💡 Usage

1. Press `Ctrl+U` to launch the assistant (via `fzf`)
2. Type a command fragment _or_ a natural question (multi-language supported)
3. Select one of the AI-suggested commands

> Example: `how do I list docker containers by name?`

See [`project-docs/examples.md`](./project-docs/examples.md) for full walkthroughs.
